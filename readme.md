## 🌍 Overview
COS Approval Tracker is an **ethical, compliance‑sensitive governance tool** that integrates **NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)** data into donor and ESG approval workflows.  

By validating fire risk in real time and generating **audit‑ready JSON reports**, the platform reduces approval timelines from **10+ days to just 3**, preventing costly delays and enabling climate‑aware decision‑making.  

---

## ✨ Key Features
- 🔥 Real‑time fire risk validation (NASA FIRMS)  
- 📑 Audit‑ready JSON reports for banks, donors, and regulators  
- ⚡ 60% faster approvals  
- 💰 $2M+ in delays prevented per project cycle  
- 🌱 Direct support for **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)** and **SDG 13 (Climate Action)**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native  
- **Backend:** Node.js  
- **Database & Auth:** Firebase / Firestore  
- **APIs:** NASA FIRMS  
- **Other Tools:** Docker, Google Cloud  

---

## 📈 Results & Impact
- ⏱️ Reduced donor approval time: **10+ days → 3 days**  
- 💰 Prevented **$2M+ in delays per project cycle**  
- 🌱 Strengthened ESG compliance and SDG alignment  
- 🌍 Scalable beyond construction into finance, infrastructure, and sustainability

## 📖 COS & SMART Methodology
COS Approval Tracker is built on the **COS methodology** and **SMART tools** developed by **Susil Bhandari, CCM**, and documented in his book:  

*An Approach to Construction Management Challenges: Integrating Digital, ESG, and SMART Frameworks*  

**Key Concepts from the Book:**  
- COS Dashboards → compliance checkpoints and audit‑ready outputs  
- SMART Action Registers → accountability with measurable triggers  
- Case Studies → real‑world results from Nepal, Bahrain, and Qatar  
- Scalability → adaptable frameworks for ESG, digital, and global governance
