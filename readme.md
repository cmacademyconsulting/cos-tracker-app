# COS Approval Tracker

**Built for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025**  
**Team COS | Nepal 🇳🇵 | SDG 11 & 13**

---

## 🌍 Overview
COS Approval Tracker is a compliance‑sensitive governance tool that integrates **NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)** data into donor and ESG approval workflows.  
By validating fire risk in real time and generating **audit‑ready JSON reports**, the platform reduces approval timelines from **10+ days to just 3**, preventing costly delays and enabling climate‑aware decision‑making.

## 📖 Project Details
**What it does:**  
Transforms raw NASA satellite data into transparent, bank‑ready compliance outputs.  

**Benefits:**  
- Faster donor approvals  
- Reduced financial risk  
- Strengthened ESG compliance  
- Scalable beyond construction into finance, infrastructure, and sustainability  

**Intended Impact:**  
Enable **faster, climate‑aware decision‑making** for infrastructure and urban development projects worldwide.  

**Creativity:**  
Built on the **COS methodology** (Compliance Operating System), originally developed for construction management and now scaled as a universal governance solution.

## 🤖 Ethical Statement & AI Use
COS Approval Tracker is built on the original **COS methodology**, developed by **Susil Bhandari, CCM**, and documented in his authored book *An Approach to Construction Management Challenges*.  

AI tools were used **only as supportive accelerators** — for drafting summaries, refining slide layouts, and structuring demo narration. All AI‑assisted outputs were reviewed, validated, and aligned with the **core COS philosophy**.  

The **logic, compliance workflows, and governance tools** remain original intellectual work, derived from decades of professional practice and published frameworks.  
We affirm that the **innovation, methodology, and system design are our own**, and that AI was used ethically, transparently, and in line with NASA’s guidelines.
