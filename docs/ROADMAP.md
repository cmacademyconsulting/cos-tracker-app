# 🛣️ COS Approval Tracker – Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of **COS Approval Tracker**, extending beyond the NASA Space Apps 2025 submission into a scalable, professional compliance solution.  
It reflects the **COS methodology** and **SMART tools** authored by *Susil Bhandari, CCM*, and aligns with CM Academy’s mission to deliver ethical, transparent, and globally scalable governance solutions.

## 🌟 Long‑Term Goals (18+ months)
- 🧭 **Global Scaling**: Expand COS Approval Tracker to multiple regions (South Asia, Middle East, Africa)  
- 🧩 **Sector Expansion**: Apply COS methodology to finance, infrastructure, and sustainability compliance  
- 🤖 **AI‑Assisted Insights**: Ethical AI for predictive risk analysis (transparent, audit‑ready, no black‑box logic)  
- 🏛️ **Accreditation & Standards**: Position COS Approval Tracker as a reference tool for international compliance frameworks  
- 🏆 **CM Academy Portfolio**: Establish the project as a flagship offering for training, consulting, and global outreach

## 📜 Guiding Principles
- **Ethics First**: AI as an accelerator, never as the originator of compliance logic  
- **Audit‑Ready Always**: Every output must withstand regulator and donor scrutiny  
- **Scalable by Design**: From local pilots to global adoption  
- **Aligned with SDGs**: Especially **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)** and **SDG 13 (Climate Action)**
