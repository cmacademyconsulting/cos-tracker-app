# 🤝 Ethics & Compliance Statement

This project, **COS Approval Tracker**, is built on the principles of **transparency, originality, and ethical governance**.  
It reflects the **COS (Compliance Operating System) methodology** authored by **Susil Bhandari, CCM**, and aligns with the mission of **CM Academy** to deliver scalable, audit‑ready compliance solutions worldwide.

## 🔑 Core Ethical Principles
1. **Originality & Ownership** – COS methodology and SMART tools are original works by Susil Bhandari, CCM.  
2. **Responsible AI Use** – AI is used only as a supportive accelerator (drafting, formatting), never as originator of compliance logic.  
3. **Audit‑Readiness & Transparency** – All outputs are designed to withstand donor/regulator scrutiny.  
4. **Alignment with Global Standards** – CMAA Code of Ethics, ESG, SDG 11 & 13.  
5. **Service to Communities** – Tools are designed to reduce delays, save costs, and enable climate‑aware decision‑making.
